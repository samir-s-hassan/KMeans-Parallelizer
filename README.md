## How to run

./run.sh 

To run this program, please enter the command above followed by one or more of the letters s, f, p, or c FOLLOWED by the name of your dataset which should be in the datasets/folder. Notice that we are calling the dataset by its name.txt

s - Serial implementation provided by the Professor  
f - Faster, serial implementation attempt by me (may or may not be faster, really)  
p - Parallel implementation by me  
c - Concurrent implementation attempt by me (may or may not be concurrent/working)  

Example commands:  
./run.sh s f  
(runs the serial and faster serial implementation with the default dataset)    

./run.sh s f p c  
(runs the serial, faster serial, parallel, and concurrent implementation with the default dataset)    

./run.sh s  
(runs only the serial implementation with the default dataset)  

./run.sh c f 2.txt  
(runs the concurrent and faster serial implementation with the 2.txt dataset)    

./run.sh s f p c 3.txt  
(runs the serial, faster serial, parallel, and concurrent implementation with the 3.txt dataset)    

./run.sh p 2.txt  
(runs only the serial implementation with the default dataset)
